# Week5

For this week, we will be looking at some basic cleaning protocols that are often used while preparing data for various forms of analysis. Consider your reading from Mu√±os and Rawson. What happens when we normalize even the small bit of data that we are working with in this example. 

For an additional challenge, some students may choose to do the sentiment analysis portion of the notebook. Others may consider changing various parts of the workbook, practice importing data from the NLTK corpus, and running the normalization on it. As you read along in the lessons from DataCamp, see if you can bring what you're learning about Python into this notebook and make some changes.
